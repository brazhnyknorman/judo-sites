# Judo Sites

**Do you ever wish you could have all of your cool URL bookmarks on your USB, instead of a google
account you have to sign into?** This is the reason I am making this below barebones HTML page.
I don't like how cluttered Google bookmarks can get, and even after I organize them, I don't see
myself using them too often for Judo.

**Instead**, I will add those websites to this HTML index. I think it's just cooler to have one
of those (retroactively) ugly websites that I use for useful Judo links in my back pocket.
